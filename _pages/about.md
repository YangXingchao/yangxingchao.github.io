My name is Xingchao Yang and I work as a research scientist at [Cyberagent AILab](https://cyberagent.ai/ailab/). currently, I am also a doctoral student in the [Computational Geometry and Graphics Lab](http://www.cgg.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/) at the University of Tsukuba, where I am advised by Associate Professor [Yoshihiro Kanamori](http://kanamori.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/index.html), I earned my master's degree from the [Yamaguchi Lab](https://www.graco.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/yama-lab/index.php) at the University of Tokyo.

My research interests are in the areas of deep learning, 3D computer vision, and computer graphics. Specifically, I am interested in 3D morphable model, 3D face reconstruction, 3D makeup reconstruction and transfer, inverse rendering, and face reenactment.

In addition to my research, I also have a strong interest in [cloud engineering](https://www.credential.net/1b932925-990a-4ccf-81bc-e3316fbf3e98) and [game development](https://www.credly.com/badges/ea85c335-617f-41f3-ab8f-4e7e6611b10f/linked_in_profile).
